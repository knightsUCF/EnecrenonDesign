# Short Blurb

Step into a Lovecraftian adventure of other realms, into worlds forgotten by modern times. A world out of time and space...

# Set Design for the Other Realms

The game is dark because that's what the kids like, but there is no trauma in the game. The darkness is purely aesthetic, and does not seek to harm the consiousness of the player, just scare them a little with the fear of the unknown.

"The oldest and strongest emotion is fear, and the oldest type of fear is the fear of the unknown" - Lovecraft

Lovecraftian world

Not gruesome and torturuous but classy and delicious darkness and exciting and interesting ancient ruins and labyrinthian structures

The most terrifying and frightening monster is the one that isnâ€™t there for us to see and grasp, so the atmosphere of the setting as an abstract monster, the howling wind, whispers in the darkness, the desolation of the place, the eerie loneliness, a haunting of past ghosts... etc

Strange markings, hieroglyphics on stone structures

High up bridges, and platforms which can evoke a fear of heights from the player

Towering high structures, which with sheer scale can impress a grand design upon the player, especially in VR

Spaces set up for combat, choke points, covers, narrow points to make a run to get away, enemy attack surprises from hidden spots

Lovecraft was a master of atmosphere

big canvas of effects, not just one

treking across desolate landscapes

discovering fossiled remains, ancient cities

dreamlands

lost worlds

horrors of deep space

interstellar races

whispers in darkness "The Whisperer in the Darkness" by Lovecraft

other dimensions, other realms

outlandish

strong sense of context and place

classy horror / archaic ancient dark fantasy

out in the middle of nowhere

knee to waist deep water caverns filled with slimy swimming things unknown: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/2xdvBx

delicious eccentric darkness

labyrinthian ancient ruins

decadent ancient structures

infinite leagues of dark air

howling wind, desolation

unfortunate madness

curse

weird fiction / strange tales

18th / 19th / 20th century horror

the scale of man in the cosmos

there is an indifference from the ancient gods / the cosmos to mankind

"the old ones" "cthulhu"

the lovecraft grand mythos, where everything sort of fits in

the pitch would be things much older than mankind and earth are gazing upon us with indifference and cruelty - guillermo del toro

weird tentacled creatures coming from other worlds, have been banished and will return some day

that force beyond us that we are incapable of controlling

the universe is vaster than we can comprehend

a malign world, a place surrounded by evil, mad, horrible monstrous things always trying to get in, who frankly don't care about us

unknown abominations, and cosmic gods

the concept of deep time -- a time before the comprehension of man, geological time, a time scale where continents shift and species evolve and go extinct, but not something we can really process

humanity is small and fragile, and threatened

depopulated / emptiness

ancient creatures from unknown worlds and dimensions

# Set Design for the Manor

aristocracy

well educated / well read

old money

classy

gentlemen

honesty

dignity

astronomy / chemistry interests 

Sherlock Holmes - esque

beautiful night / full moon 

fog

owls hoots

vines overgrowth on the fences

something coming up the stairs / tentacles

the story of the thing coming briefly into the firelit and then fleeing into the darkness

classic Lovecraftian setup: unleash a cosmic malady on an isolated farmland / manor

something poisons and begins to mutate the landwscape

a transcendental quanlity of terror that the best of Lovecraft achieved

a ring of stones, indian, set up in the woods in the back of the manor (The Dunwich Horror)

necronomicon, summons guardian of the gates, past present and future from The Dunwich Horror

Could have something like this hanging on the walls:

Gate we could use in the woods as a portal: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/medieval-ruin-entrance-711292d5a5c343ceb675782b24f213ee

Has some of the dark aesthetic for the woods surrounding the manor:

# Design for Creatures

We could use this for the zombie like creatures near the manor: http://www.cthulhushop.com/lovecramorphosis/

Here is a perfect 3D model to make the zombie creature's tentacles: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/skuthulu-c3516092202d4ec98d2cae68c308ce7d

Here is a free 3D model we could rig for a Cthulhu like creature:

Here is another amazing Chtulhu model, all we have to do is rig and find the animations, or create them:

And a flying version:

# Lovecraft Creature / Hierarchy Mythos


Outer Gods

Azathoth, most powerful deity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNY-H3cwxmU (nice background music)

If Azathoth awakens, we will be winked out of existence. Perhaps this could be the goal of the game, to find Azathoth and defeat him before he wakes and brings about the end of the universe.

Yog - Sothoth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmZP0VSENCA

Nice quote at the end we could use for the game.

Shub - Niggurath: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAf5hz1tf2E

Nyarlathotep - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYEBQJoz1_c

Great Old Ones (confined to physical location)

Cthulhu
